alert(j.name);

Why would this code not work as expected? Is anything missing?

ANS==============================

1st thing is >>this.name = name;  this is Java pattern where you classify the class variable as this to store the value of the parameters entered
so the right way is to get a value from the function by using return which was missing
2nd thing is>>> j.name is used improperly because j is not an object and name is not any property of the object j

function User(name) {

   return name;

};



var j = User('Jack');

alert(j);

I'm iterating through this array I defined, it has 3 elements in it.. the numbers 1 2 and 3.. 
Why on earth is jack showing up?

ANS================================================
For in loop in  JavaScript is aimed to iterate over object properties. Since we have created an object prototype for all the objects, it will appear. 
The BEST WAY TO ITERATE THIS LOOP AS>>>>>

for (var i=0; i<a.length; i++) {
  alert(a[i]);

Why is this not working in Internet Explorer?

ANS======================
BECAUSE SOME LOOPS ARE NEW AND NOT ACCEPTABLE BY IE BUT CHROME
ONE OF THE OTHER EXAMPLE IS forEach(function (arg1, arg2){

Why does it alert undefined when I declared the jack variable to be 'Jack'?


ANS==================================================  

<script>
      var jack;
    (function() {
        jack = 'Jack';
    })();
    alert(typeof jack);
</script>

Reason=== var jack was defined in the function therefore scope is limited just within the function
and also semicolon is misisng from the last line

function identity() {

    alert(name);
    return
    name
};
var who = identity();
alert(who)

Why does it first alert Jack, then undefined?
ANS============================================

function identity() {
    var name = 'Jack';
    alert(name);
    return name;
};
var who = identity();
alert(who);



PROPER WAY TO RETURN SOMETHING IS >>>> return name; 
it showed undefined because there was no variable after return
Now with the right code it shows jack two times
1st one function alert the name Jack
2nd one as we passed the function with alert(who); so it is returning the value jack so it is like alert(jack).
Now the code is good

ticket is set to true. 
Why is it alerting that I need to purchase one?

ANS=====================================================
FIRST OF ALL IT IS BAD PRACTICE TO WRITE THE CODE LIKE THAT WIHOUT BRACKETS
AND THE REASON WHY IT SKIPPED THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE THE CONDITION DIDN'T MEET SO IT ALERTED THE SECOND ONE



THE RIGHT WAY TO IMPLEMENT THIS CODE

 var ticket = true;



    
if (!ticket)

alert('you need a ticket');

Why do the anchors, when clicked on, alert 2 instead of their respective counter inside of the loop (0 and 1)? 
How can you fix the code so that it does alert the right number?

ANS=======================================

IT ALERTS NUMBER 2 ON BOTH BECAUSE 
ONCE THE LOOP IS OVER THE VALUE OF I WILL BE 2 , THE FUNCTION JOB IS TO ALERT THE VALUE OF I ONCLICK SO IT'S RETURNING 2. 
Every anonymous function thet we define inside your loop reads the value of "i" at the end of the for loop.


<script>

function addingClick(element, i) {
    element.onclick = function() {
        alert(i);
